Automatically add Facebook Open Graph and Twitter Card support to your WordPress website.

== Description ==

Add Facebook and Twitter sharing for your blog posts and pages!  Sharing your blog posts with Social Media Sharing automatically provides important details like featured images, title, and description to your blog so pages and posts look fantastic on Facebook or Twitter.  Social Media Sharing adds Facebook Open Graph metadata and Twitter Card support to every page on your site, support for default descriptions or photos, and uses your featured images as thumbnails on social media.

**Note:** Twitter Card support requires approval from twitter. You can request approval at the [twitter card validator](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/validation/validator).
